  [NicEdit](http://nicedit.com). is a free inline WYSIWYG html content editor created by Brian Kirchoff, that allow you easily editing of web site content on the fly in the browser. Its the best
  rich text editor i have used for my websites. Since I set it up for a social network, I have decided to publish the customizations I did to make it fit for a social network
  
##Features
 - Pre tag highlighting: If you wanted to highlight some text in the body of your text, that's possible. You just need to write some css for < pre> </ pre>
 - Youtube embedding: Just paste a youtube link in the youtube menu, and the video will be embedded into your current cusor position
 - Text stripping and cleanup: if a body of text is copied from another website, all the text colors, background colors and so one will not appear to avoid having them mess up the page. The only things that will appear are the text, videos and images. 
 - Font Settings were removed: You can added them back using the instructions in the demo pages of official nicEdit site.
